# Super Smart - GovHack 2020

COVID-19 has presented massive hardships and challenges to many Australians, and in a post-pandemic world, we see a re-imagining of our societies. Financial goals. Lifestyle priorities. Employment opportunities. 

Our project gives insights into how we can imagine life in the new normal, using the super withdrawal scheme to give Australians an opportunity to re-evaluate and explore their options for the long-term. We see regional and rural Australia and its thriving local communities as an answer to some of the challenges.

Our platform allows users to see their financial situation at a glance and quantify the impact of living in a regional area, alongside an algorithm that matches their priorities to a suitable area. It could be opportunities for job seekers, the amenities and lifestyle that matches their familyâ€™s goals, or how a change of pace could work for them in retirement. 

The post COVID-19 Australia is here.
